## Question

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Algorithm

We need 3 number variables to walk through sequence without storing all the numbers:

i: the previous number in the sequence
j: the current number in the sequence
j2: variable for storing the new value of j temporarily
